Hi, I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneswar, India. I love learning and I am inclined towards a career in research and teaching. Right now, I am exploring different domains within CS to try and get a first-hand experience of the practical problems taken up in a research lab. I have taken core courses in **Data Structures and Algorithms, Automata Theory, Probability and Statistics, Database Management, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Object Oriented Programming**. Currently, I am taking a summer internship at IIT Kharagpur, where I am a part of a project on the geometric analysis of [Mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) in the context of computational art. This is my first foray into a research environment in real-time. 

My interests lie in machine learning, computational geometry and data sciences and data management. I am looking for opportunities to learn more and gain hands-on experience in these domains in particular. I am proficient in programming languages such as **Python, Java, SQL** and **C**, with experience in using modules such as matplotlib, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn. 

In my free time, I like to try out different hobbies. I enjoy art in all its forms, crochet, playing the ukulele and the keyboard, reading both fiction and non-fiction, and solving puzzles. I like to think of myself as someone who loves learning, and this love extends beyond my academic pursuits.

I am eager to connect with individuals and gain opportunities that will help me grow and contribute. Please feel free to look at [my CV](https://maitreyeehere.github.io/maitreyee.github.io/portfolio/) or reach out to me at maitreyeesar@gmail.com.

Hope you have a great day! :)
